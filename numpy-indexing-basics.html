                <h1>Basic Indexing in Numpy</h1>
                <p>
                Given its ubiquity in the world of scientific computing and machine learning, it's worth spending some time to get to know numpy a bit better.
                I've been enjoying <a href="http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier">Nicolas P. Rougier's</a> interactive collection of exercises
                 called <a href="https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100">the numpy 100<a>. He also wrote a short book
                <a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/">From Python to Numpy</a> meant to act as a second course, after one
                is familiar with the basics of numpy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this short note we'll look at exercise 19 where we are tasked with creating a matrix that has a checkerboard pattern.
                    This exercise is a good illustration of basic indexing in numpy. Let's take a look.

                <h2>Indexing and Slices in Python3</h2>
                Let's step back a little and look at standard Python3. The expression <code>x[k]</code>
                is called a subscription: we're accessing the k-th element of the collection x. This is analogous to, i.e., subscripting a vector in
                mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                Python also has <em>slices</em>. According to the Python3 glossary,
                <blockquote>
                    An object usually containing a portion of a sequence. A slice is created using the subscript notation, [] with colons
                    between numbers when several are given, such as in variable_name[1:3:5]. The brack (subscript) notation uses slice
                    objects internally.
                </blockquote>
                The builtin function <code>slice</code> can be used to create a slice. In fact, the notation <code>1:3:5</code> (called extended indexing syntax) is syntactic sugar
                for the expression <code>slice(1,3,5)</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                According to the Python3 language reference, the slice function returns a slice object that represents
                <blockquote>
                    the set of indices specified by range(start, stop, step). The start and step arguments default to None.
                </blockquote>
                The step argument for slicing was adding way back in Python 1.4 "at the request of the developers of Numerical Python, which uses the third argument [step] extensively." The patch adding this was contributed by Michael Hudson.
                <br>
                The reference also notes that
                <blockquote>
                    Slice objects have read-only data attributes start, stop, and step which merely return the argument values (or their default).
                    They have no other explicit functionality; however, they are used by NumPy and other third-party packages.
                </blockquote>

            <p>
              Let's gain some (standard Python3) slice experience. Suppose we have a sequence x, say <code>x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]</code>, and we 
            want all the odd-indexed elements. This means we want to start at index 1, the lowest odd index, and get the next element at 3, and so on.
            This precisely corresponds to <code>range(1,len(x),2)</code>, or more simply, <code>x[1::2]</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now what if we want to set the elements of x to zero at every even index? It's natural to attempt the following:
            <br><code>
x[::2] = 0 
            </code><br>
            but this throws an exception: <code>TypeError: must assign iterable to extended slice</code><br>
            so we have to do something like
            <br><code>
x[::2] = [0 for _ in range(len(x[::2]))]
            </code>
            <br>
            Note that the length of the sequence on the left-hand side must equal the length of the right-hand sequence. This is specifically a
            quirk of extended slices -- assignments to regular slices can change the sequence's length:
            <br><code>
a = list(range(3))
a[1:3] = [4,5,6]
            </code><br>
            which gives <code>[0,4,5,6]</code> as the value of <code>a</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
            One last note about normal Python's subscripting and slicing: they support negatives. If we have a sequence x and we want the final
            element, we can index it as <code>x[-1]</code>
            or, if we want the penultimate element <code>x[-2]</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
            If we have a sequence x and we want to reverse it,
            we can simply use an extended slice with a -1 step-size: <code>x[::-1]</code>
            </p>
            </section>
            <section>
            <h2>Indexing in Numpy</h2>
            <p>Now let's take a look at numpy. There's a <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html">whole section</a> of the documentation devoted just to indexing.
            The main object of numpy is the ndarray, representing an n-dimensional array -- i.e. multidimensional containers whose elements have the same type and size.
            An ndarray is indexed just like a python list or other container: <code>array[index]</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
            One difference is in how multidimensional (nested) indexing works.
            Whereas a nested list in python needs to be indexed like so <code>array[index1][index2]</code>, numpy ndarrays accept a tuple like so <code>ndarray[(1,3)]</code>
            or, equivalently, we can drop the parentheses for clarity, as in <code>ndarray[1,3]</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Slicing is also supported: <code>ndarray[start:stop:step]</code>.
            </p>
            </section>
            <section>
            <p>Now we can solve exercise 19 by taking slices and assigning to them. Values being assigned to indexed ndarrays
            "must be shape consistent (the same shape or broadcastable to the shape the index produces)". This implies we can assign
            a constant to a slice
            <br><code>
ndarray[start:stop:step] = const
            </code><br>
            which would throw an exception for a normal python container as we saw earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
            Our checkerboard is an 8x8 matrix, which we can create with <code>board = np.zeros((8,8))</code>.
            Observe that the slice <code>::2</code> produces all even indices, so <code>board[0,::2] = 1</code>
            produces
            <br><code>
array([[1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]])
            </code><br>
            We want this pattern on every even-indexed row, so we write <code>board[::2,::2] = 1</code>,
            which gives
            <br><code>
array([[1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]])
            </code><br>
            Now we want to do something similar, but for the odd columns of the odd rows, so we'll try <code> board[1::2, 1::2] = 1</code>,
            which gives us the result we wanted:<br>
            <code>
array([[1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1.],
       [1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1.],
       [1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1.],
       [1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1.]])
            </code><br>
            Incidentally we can save precious memory by setting the checkerboard ndarray's type to int.
