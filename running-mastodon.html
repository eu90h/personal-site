        I recently spent a couple hours configuring a Mastodon instance and thought I'd record some troubles I
        encountered and their solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully, Mastodon installation and configuration is pretty easy. The <a
          href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/install/">installation manual</a> is comprehensive and easy to
        follow (just make sure you do each step as stated, in the correct order).

        The biggest problem I encountered was that the <code>bundle exec rails assets:precompile</code> step failed because
        my VM ran out of memory. I also had installed the latest node version, which seemed to cause some
        incompatibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to get the right node version, we can run
        <br/><code>
sudo apt-get remove nodejs
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource/com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
        </code><br/>
        Some GitHub messages suggested node18, which is a bit old now so you'll get a deprecation notice running the
        installer.

        Some searching reveals that a common way to reduce RAM requirements during the
        build process
        is to reduce build-time parallelism and turn off some Terser Webpack features. This is done in
        <code>config/webpack/product.js</code> from the root mastodon directory. The patch may be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/eu90h/b4e1467cc5df21342846c0bb6d0e97a6">here</a>.

        During setup, I decided to try out <a href="https://wasabi.com/">Wasabi</a> without realizing that public access
        is limited on
        trial/unpaid accounts. Deferring difficult storage decisions until later, I wanted to just use local storage
        instead.
        Thanks to <a
          href="https://www.bentasker.co.uk/posts/documentation/general/reconfiguring-mastodon-to-use-digitalocean-spaces-for-media-storage.html">this
          post</a>
        by Ben Tasker, I was able to easily change the storage backend post-installation.
      </p>
      <p>
        To resolve this, simply edit <code>.env.product</code> in your mastodon root directory, changing the line
        <code>S3_ENABLED=true</code> to <code>S3_ENABLED=false</code>. Of course this can be used to change from local
        to cloud storage after installation as well.
        Restart the mastodon services to ensure the changes take effect.
