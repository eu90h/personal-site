            <h3>The Prosecutor's Fallacy</h3>
            <p>Exercise 2.10 (attributed to Peter Lee) in volume 1 of Kevin P. Murphy's <em>Probabilistic Machine Learning</em> concerns legal reasoning. It says:
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Suppose a crime has been committed. Blood is found at the scene for which there is no innocent explanation. It is of a type which is present in 1% of the population.</p>
                     <p>The prosecutor claims: "There is a 1% chance that the defendant would have the crime blood type if he were innocent. Thus there is a 99% chance he is guilty". 
                        This is known as the <b>prosecutor's fallacy</b>. What is wrong with this argument?</p>
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
                In its essence, the prosecutor's fallacy is when one improperly assumes that \(\text{Pr}[A|B] = \text{Pr}[B|A]\).
                This error occurs in many scenarios, including epidemiology [0], law [1], ecology [2], and likely anywhere probability theory is used.

        <section>
            <p>Let's work out exercise 2.10 (above) to get a better understanding of this issue.</p>
            <p>
                Let
                $$
                \begin{align}
                E = \text{rare blood type collected from the crime scene} \\
                B = \text{defendant has rare blood type from crime scene} \\
                I = \text{defendant is innocent} \\
                \neg{I} = \text{defendant is guilty}
                \end{align}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let's try to phrase the prosecutor's argument mathematically. It appears that the prosecutor has incorrectly asserted that
                $$
                \text{Pr}\left[B|I,E\right] = 0.01 \implies \text{Pr}\left[\neg I|B,E\right] = 0.99
                $$
                How did the prosecutor arrive at this implication?
            </p>
            <p>
                Recall that we are interested in the probability that the defendant is innocent given the evidence we've actually observed, \(\text{Pr}\left[I | B, E\right]\).
                Using Bayes' theorem, we may write
                $$
                \text{Pr}\left[I|B, E\right] = \frac{\text{Pr}\left[B|I, E\right]\,\text{Pr}\left[I|E\right]}{\text{Pr}\left[B|I,E\right]\,\text{Pr}\left[I|E\right]+\text{Pr}\left[B|\neg I, E\right]\,\text{Pr}\left[\neg I | E\right]}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let's consider the conditions under which the prosecutor's implication is true. For their argument to work, we would need \(\text{Pr}\left[I|B,E\right] = \text{Pr}\left[B|I,E\right]\).</p>
                <p>Observe that \(\text{Pr}\left[B|I,E]\right]=\text{Pr}\left[B\right] = 0.01\). Now, if the defendant were guilty, the probability that the rare blood at the crime scene was theirs is now 100%, so \(\text{Pr}\left[B|\neg I, E\right] = 1\)
            </p>
            <p>
                We can then rewrite the conditional probability of innocence like so:
                $$
                \text{Pr}\left[I|B,E\right] = \frac{\text{Pr}\left[B|I,E\right]\text{Pr}\left[I|E\right]}{\text{Pr}\left[B|I,E\right]\text{Pr}\left[I|E\right] + (1 - \text{Pr}\left[I|E\right])}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>
                Recall that the prosecutor assumes that \(\text{Pr}\left[I|B,E\right] = \text{Pr}\left[B|I,E\right]\). We can use this to rewrite the equation above:
                $$
                \text{Pr}\left[I|B,E\right]\left(1 - \frac{\text{Pr}\left[I|E\right]}{\text{Pr}\left[B|I,E\right]\text{Pr}\left[I|E\right] + (1 - \text{Pr}\left[I|E\right])}\right) = 0
                $$
            </p>
            <p>
                This forces the parenthetical expression to vanish:
                $$
                1 - \frac{\text{Pr}\left[I|E\right]}{\text{Pr}\left[B|I,E\right]\text{Pr}\left[I|E\right] + (1 - \text{Pr}\left[I|E\right])} = 0
                $$
            </p>
            <p>
                Multiplying by the denominator and performing some algebra, we find that
                $$
                \text{Pr}\left[I|E\right](\text{Pr}\left[B|I,E\right] - 2) + 1 = 0
                $$
                or
                $$
                \text{Pr}\left[I|E\right] = \frac{1}{2 - \text{Pr}\left[B|I,E\right]}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>
                We were given the probability \(\text{Pr}\left[B|I,E\right] = 0.01\), so \(\text{Pr}\left[I|E\right] = \frac{100}{199} \approx 0.5\).
                This whole derivation only works if we're willing to accept that the base rate of guilt is essentially a coin flip.
            </p>

                Presumption of innocence is considered a fundamental right in many countries across the world.
                The burden of proof that an individual is guilty falls upon the prosecutor.
                In a criminal trial like the one outlined in the example, the prosecution has to establish
                <em>beyond any reasonable doubt</em> that the accused is in fact guilty.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we're on a jury and the prosecutor tries the argument we analyzed above, we can only accept it if we think that the base rate of innocence is 50%.
                This is incompatible with a presumption of innocence, and thus violates the defendant's rights.
