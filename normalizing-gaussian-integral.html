                <p>
                    The goal here is to compute the integral
                    $$
                    Z = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx
                    $$
                    where \(\sigma > 0\) is a real number.

                    I've always felt the solution to this has an air of mystery to it - it's not immediately obvious how one might have come up with this.
                    Lucky for us, Sim√©on Denis Poisson did all the hard work in the early 1800s.

                    Sometimes, to solve a tough problem, it can be easier to solve a related problem and relate the solution to our original problem.

                    We want to compute
                    $$
                    Z = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx.
                    $$
                    Instead, we're going to first compute 
                    $$
                    Z^2 = \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx\right)^2.
                    $$

                    Starting from
                    $$
                    Z^2 = \left(\int_{-a}^{a}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx\right)^2,
                    $$
                    observe that
                    $$
                    \begin{equation}
                    \begin{aligned}
                    Z^2 &= \left(\int_{-a}^{a}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx\right)^2 \\
                        &= \left(\int_{-a}^{a}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx\right)\left(\int_{-a}^{a}e^{-\frac{y^2}{2\sigma^2}}dy\right) \\
                        &= \int_{-a}^{a}\int_{-a}^{a}\exp\left({-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x^2 + y^2)}\right)dxdy.
                    \end{aligned}
                    \end{equation}
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the decisive step: we make the substitution \(x=r\cos\theta,\, y=r\sin\theta\).
                    (When integrating, an expression like \(x^2 + y^2\) is <em>screaming</em> for a trigonometric substitution.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    At a minimum, \(r\) is zero at \(x=0,\,y=0\); it attains its maximum \(r = a\sqrt{2}\) at the points \((\pm a, \pm a)\). The angle \(\theta\), on the other hand, lies in \([0,2\pi)\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The infinitesimal area element \(dxdy\) is now transformed into \(rdrd\theta\), so our integral then becomes
                    $$
                    \begin{equation}
                    \begin{aligned}
                    Z^2 &= \int_{0}^{a\sqrt{2}}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\exp\left({-\frac{r^2}{2\sigma^2}}\right)rd\theta dr
                    \end{aligned}
                    \end{equation}
                    $$
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now let's proceed to calculating the integral. The inner integral with respect to \(\theta\) is simple:
                    $$
                    \int_{0}^{2\pi}\exp\left({-\frac{r^2}{2\sigma^2}}\right)rd\theta = 2\pi\exp\left({-\frac{r^2}{2\sigma^2}}\right)r
                    $$
                    so we're left with
                    $$
                    Z^2 = 2\pi \int_{0}^{a\sqrt{2}}\exp\left({-\frac{r^2}{2\sigma^2}}\right)rdr
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    This final integral is easily computed with the substitution \(u={r^2}/{2\sigma^2}\), so we end up with
                    $$
                    Z^2 = 2\pi\sigma^2 (1 - \exp(-\frac{a^2}{\sigma^2}))
                    $$
                    Now let's take the limit as \(a\rightarrow\infty\), which yields
                    $$
                    \lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}Z^2 = 2\pi\sigma^2 (1 - \lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\exp(-\frac{a^2}{\sigma^2})) = 2\pi\sigma^2
                    $$

                    Therefore,
                    $$
                    Z = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx = \sigma\sqrt{2\pi}
                    $$
